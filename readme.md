# Simpplr-GenSpark-Training Frontend Development

## Overview

This repository contains the code for the **Simpplr-GenSpark-Training** program, where I am learning and developing frontend skills. The code pushed to this repo is part of my training journey, focusing on building practical, real-world frontend applications using and other modern web technologies.

## Purpose

The repository serves as a record of my progress during the training program. As I continue learning, I will push code that demonstrates my understanding and application of various frontend development concepts, including:

- Learning how **React** works internally.
- Understanding **TypeScript**, **JavaScript**, **hooks**, **props**, and more.
- Implementing best practices for scalable frontend architectures.
- Building UI using **HTML**, **CSS**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Bootstrap**.
