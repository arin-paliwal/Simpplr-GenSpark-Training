                The sun has set, the day is done, 
                
                The stars appear, one by one.
                
                A gentle breeze begins to blow,
                
                As night unfolds its peaceful glow.
                
                The moonlight dances on the lake,
                
                Reflecting dreams that softly wake.
                
                In this quiet, tranquil place,
                
                I find my heart&apos;s most sacred space.
